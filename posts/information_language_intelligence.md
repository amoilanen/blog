#Information, Language and Intelligence

*Why probability, non-determinism, time and causality may not be universal notions, why it is hard to write in functional programming languages, why more sophisticated and less generally applicable theories are needed to get more insight into a particular problem, why modern computers and “artificial intelligence” are not at all intelligent, why philosophy rarely uses the language of mathematics, what is common between art, literature, natural languages and computer programs, what intelligence may really mean and the central place of language in understanding it.*<br/><br/><br/>

##Information
---

We will define information informally as, although it is something quite intuitive and commonplace, it is quite hard to give an exact definition without imposing unnecessarily strict limitations on what the notion of information can encompass. Let's also note that quite often information is confused with a particular way to represent it, for example, zeros and ones in a computer memory are just a representation of information and are not information themselves.
At the same time one of the most important properties of information is that it can be encoded and represented by different means. Information is a very generic notion, in particular everything perceivable by a human is just an encoding of some information. Information is a somewhat elusive notion as we really do not perceive it in its original form if there is any but only through various means in which traces of information can be observed.

##Language
---

By language we understand a particular way to encode information. The notion of language as we define it is a much wider and more universal notion than just human languages, programming languages, or mathematical notation. For example, music and various art forms can also be viewed as languages for expressing information. In general everything which is perceivable is information encoded by means of multiple languages which can be understood by a particular agent, and human speach or executable instructions for a machine form just a couple of particular classes of the languages that we can perceive.<br/><br/>

__Simplicity__ of a language is determined by the ability required from an agent trying to perceive the information encoded in this language.

For example, zeros and ones stored in the computer memory may not be a simple enough language for humans to understand without some help from a computer. In case of humans an example of a simpler language is the language of numbers when it is used to describe the quantity of some type of objects.

Simplicity is therefore a relative and subjective notion for a particular agent or group of agents, as what can seem like a simple language to one agent can be prohibitively difficult to another agent.<br/><br/>

__Formality__ is the quality of preserving the original information being encoded. For example, intuitively it is clear that the symbolic language of mathematics is more formal than any spoken human language when dealing with computing speed of change or derivatives. Accidentally, also the language of mathematics is also simpler in this particular case.

It may be at first a bit surprizing that even such a formal way to represent information as mathematical notation may not be "strict enough" as some information may be lost when we try to encode it as symbols. In fact, the Gödel theorem about the incompleteness of the axiomatic arithmetic shows that the language of general relational logic is not strict enough in precisely this sense http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/

<br/><br/>

__General applicability__ of a language can be judged from its ability to encode information in general. For example, a spoken human language can be used to encode poetry, while the language of mathematics much less so, in this way the spoken language is more generally applicable than mathematics.<br/><br/>

It is quit obvious that information encoded in some particular language can then be encoded again in another language, and we can then talk about translation from one language to another. Languages can also be used to define other languages and we can reason about relationships between different languages as well. But in order to stay focused we will largely omit this discussion in the present essay.
