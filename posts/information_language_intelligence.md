#Information, Language and Intelligence
---

*Why probability, non-determinism, time and causality may not be universal notions, why it is hard to write in functional programming languages, why more sophisticated and less generally applicable theories are needed to get more insight into a particular problem, why modern computers and “artificial intelligence” are not at all intelligent, why philosophy rarely uses the language of mathematics, what is common between art, literature, natural languages and computer programs, what intelligence may really mean and the central place of language in understanding it.*<br/><br/><br/>

##Information
---

We will define __information__ informally as, although it is something quite intuitive and commonplace, it is quite hard to give an exact definition without imposing unnecessarily strict limitations on what the notion of information can encompass. Let's also note that quite often information is confused with a particular way to represent it, for example, zeros and ones in a computer memory are just a representation of information and are not information themselves.
At the same time one of the most important properties of information is that it can be encoded and represented by different means. Information is a very generic notion, in particular everything perceivable by a human is just an encoding of some information. Information is a somewhat elusive notion as we really do not perceive it in its original form if there is any but only through various means in which traces of information can be observed.

##Language
---

By __language__ we understand a particular way to encode information. The notion of language as we define it is a much wider and more universal notion than just human languages, programming languages, or mathematical notation. For example, music and various art forms can also be viewed as languages for expressing information. In general everything which is perceivable is information encoded by means of multiple languages which can be understood by a particular agent, and human speach or executable instructions for a machine form just a couple of particular classes of the languages that we can perceive.<br/><br/>

__Simplicity__ of a language is determined by the ability required from an agent trying to perceive the information encoded in this language.

For example, zeros and ones stored in the computer memory may not be a simple enough language for humans to understand without some help from a computer. In case of humans an example of a simpler language is the language of numbers when it is used to describe the quantity of some type of objects.

Simplicity is therefore a relative and subjective notion for a particular agent or group of agents, as what can seem like a simple language to one agent can be prohibitively difficult to another agent.<br/><br/>

__Formality__ is the quality of preserving the original information being encoded. For example, intuitively it is clear that the symbolic language of propositional logic is more formal than any spoken human language when dealing with describing properties of objects and relationships between them. Accidentally, the language of propositional logic is also simpler for this particular type of information.

It may be at first a bit surprizing that even such a formal way to represent information as mathematical notation may not be "formal enough" as some information may be lost when we try to encode it as symbols. In fact, one of the most important results in the field of Logic the Gödel theorem about the incompleteness of the axiomatic arithmetic shows that the language of general relational logic is not formal enough in precisely this sense http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/<br/><br/>

__Applicability__ of a language can be judged from its ability to encode information in general. For example, a spoken human language can be used to encode poetry, while the language of mathematics much less so, in this way the spoken language is more generally applicable than mathematics.<br/><br/>

It is quit obvious that information encoded in some particular language can then be encoded again in another language, and we can then talk about translation from one language to another. Languages can also be used to define other languages and we can reason about relationships between different languages as well. But in order to stay focused we will largely omit this discussion in the present essay.

Formality and applicability are own objective properties of the language itself and do not change depending on the agent interpreting the language, and simplicity is a subjective quality attributed to the language by a particular agent.

##Intelligence

Informally __intelligence__ is the ability to interpret information by a given agent. In order to do that the agent should be able to construct and understand different encodings of information (languages). These languages for a given agent should be simple enough and at the same time remain formal and applicable enough for the given subset of information. Then __intelligence__ is simply the ability to construct and understand languages and is fully defined by a set of all such possible languages. It is quite interesting to note that the last definition of intelligence does not include any mention of agents, and is done purely in terms of languages.

In the case of human intelligence having the ability to build new sufficiently simple, formal and applicable languages leads to the ability to categorize things, abstract away non-essential details and reason about the same set of information at different levels.

In the context of intelligence language simplicity can also be understood as the amount of memory and computational resources required to retrieve the encoded information. For example, in the case of human intelligence, the language of normal form games in Game Theory may not be simple enough in all cases as an exponential amount of storage may be required. Another example is determining satisfiability of expressions in propositional logic, it can require exponential time and then propositional logic is also not a simple enough language for humans in some cases.

Let's also note like we did when discussing languages in general that we can consider groups of agents, agents created by another agents in some language, relationship between different agents, etc. and talk about intelligence in every one of these cases, but this is out of scope of this short essay. We can also discuss whether the intelligence of the population of agents is greater than the intelligence of every individual agent, or whether we can define the average intelligence of a given population. Therefore, further in this essay by human intelligence we simply mean the average attainable intelligence by a human agent, and we do not talk about socium or discuss how the intelligence may increase as the technology develops, etc. These are all separate interesting topics for their own essays.

__*Hypothesis 1. (connection between applicability, simplicity and formality)*__
> For a given intelligence the corresponding set of interpretable languages is such that as the applicability tends to increase, the formality and perceived simplicity tend to decrease and vice versa.

_Examples:_

* In the case of mathematical logic proposional logic is less applicable but more formal and simpler in its resolution rules than the general relational logic.
* Philosophical texts tend to use spoken language as opposed to strict symbolic notation as it allows them to be more applicable and less narrow. Unfortunately this also means less formal and simple. In fact, this has likely been well understood by Plato as he deliberately chose to use dialogs as the form of his philosophical writing which makes it even less formal and simple than average plain philosophical text but allows to reason about things in a more general way (increases applicability).
* Computing integrals and derivations requires a simple and formal language of mathematical analysis to be developed. Yet this language is not generic enough to write general purpose novels in it and is highly specialized.
