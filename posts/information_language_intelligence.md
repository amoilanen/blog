#Information, Language and Intelligence

*Why probability, non-determinism, time and causality may not be universal notions, why it is hard to write in functional programming languages, why more sophisticated and less generally applicable theories are needed to get more insight into a particular problem, why modern computers and “artificial intelligence” are not at all intelligent, why philosophy rarely uses the language of mathematics, what is common between art, literature, natural languages and computer programs, what intelligence may really mean and the central place of language in understanding it.*<br/><br/><br/>

##Information
---

We will define __information__ informally as, although it is something quite intuitive and commonplace, it is quite hard to give an exact definition without imposing unnecessarily strict limitations on what the notion of information can encompass. Let's also note that quite often information is confused with a particular way to represent it, for example, zeros and ones in a computer memory are just a representation of information and are not information themselves.
At the same time one of the most important properties of information is that it can be encoded and represented by different means. Information is a very generic notion, in particular everything perceivable by a human is just an encoding of some information. Information is a somewhat elusive notion as we really do not perceive it in its original form if there is any but only through various means in which traces of information can be observed.

##Language
---

By __language__ we understand a particular way to encode information. The notion of language as we define it is a much wider and more universal notion than just human languages, programming languages, or mathematical notation. For example, music and various art forms can also be viewed as languages for expressing information. In general everything which is perceivable is information encoded by means of multiple languages which can be understood by a particular agent, and human speach or executable instructions for a machine form just a couple of particular classes of the languages that we can perceive.<br/><br/>

__Simplicity__ of a language is determined by the ability required from an agent trying to perceive the information encoded in this language.

For example, zeros and ones stored in the computer memory may not be a simple enough language for humans to understand without some help from a computer. In case of humans an example of a simpler language is the language of numbers when it is used to describe the quantity of some type of objects.

Simplicity is therefore a relative and subjective notion for a particular agent or group of agents, as what can seem like a simple language to one agent can be prohibitively difficult to another agent.<br/><br/>

__Formality__ is the quality of preserving the original information being encoded. For example, intuitively it is clear that the symbolic language of propositional logic is more formal than any spoken human language when dealing with describing properties of objects and relationships between them. Accidentally, the language of propositional logic is also simpler for this particular type of information.

It may be at first a bit surprizing that even such a formal way to represent information as mathematical notation may not be "formal enough" as some information may be lost when we try to encode it as symbols. In fact, one of the most important results in the field of Logic the Gödel theorem about the incompleteness of the axiomatic arithmetic shows that the language of general relational logic is not formal enough in precisely this sense http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/<br/><br/>

__Applicability__ of a language can be judged from its ability to encode information in general. For example, a spoken human language can be used to encode poetry, while the language of mathematics much less so, in this way the spoken language is more generally applicable than mathematics.<br/><br/>

It is quit obvious that information encoded in some particular language can then be encoded again in another language, and we can then talk about translation from one language to another. Languages can also be used to define other languages and we can reason about relationships between different languages as well. But in order to stay focused we will largely omit this discussion in the present essay.

Formality and applicability are own objective properties of the language itself and do not change depending on the agent interpreting the language, and simplicity is a subjective quality attributed to the language by a particular agent.

##Intelligence

Informally __intelligence__ is the ability to interpret information by a given agent. In order to do that the agent should be able to construct and understand different encodings of information (languages). These languages for a given agent should be simple enough and at the same time remain formal and applicable enough for the given subset of information. Then __intelligence__ is simply the ability to construct and understand languages and is fully defined by a set of all such possible languages. It is quite interesting to note that the last definition of intelligence does not include any mention of agents, and is done purely in terms of languages.

In the case of human intelligence having the ability to build new sufficiently simple, formal and applicable languages leads to the ability to categorize things, abstract away non-essential details and reason about the same set of information at different levels.

In the context of intelligence language simplicity can also be understood as the amount of memory and computational resources required to retrieve the encoded information. For example, in the case of human intelligence, the language of normal form games in Game Theory may not be simple enough in all cases as an exponential amount of storage may be required. Another example is determining satisfiability of expressions in propositional logic, it can require exponential time and then propositional logic is also not a simple enough language for humans in some cases.

Let's also note like we did when discussing languages in general that we can consider groups of agents, agents created by other agents in some language, relationship between different agents, etc. and talk about intelligence in every one of these cases, but this is out of scope of this short essay. We can also discuss whether the intelligence of the population of agents is greater than the intelligence of every individual agent, or whether we can define the average intelligence of a given population. Therefore, further in this essay by human intelligence we simply mean the average attainable intelligence by a human agent, and we do not talk about socium or discuss how the intelligence may increase as the technology develops, etc. These are all separate interesting topics for their own essays.

__*Hypothesis 1. (connection between applicability, simplicity and formality)*__
> For a given intelligence the corresponding set of interpretable languages is such that as the applicability tends to increase, the formality and perceived simplicity tend to decrease and vice versa.

__*Hypothesis 1. (connection between applicability, simplicity and formality)*__
> For a given intelligence the corresponding set of interpretable languages is such that as the applicability tends to increase, the formality and perceived simplicity tend to decrease and vice versa.

_Examples:_

* In the case of mathematics proposional logic is less applicable but more formal and simpler in its resolution rules than the general relational logic.
* Philosophical texts tend to use spoken language as opposed to strict symbolic notation as it allows them to be more applicable and less narrow. Unfortunately this also means less formal and simple. In fact, this has likely been well understood by Plato as he deliberately chose to use dialogs as the form of his philosophical writing which makes it even less formal than the average plain philosophical text but also allows to reason about things in a more general way (increases applicability).
* Computing integrals and derivations requires a simple and formal language of mathematical analysis to be developed. Yet this language is not generic enough to write general purpose novels in it and is highly specialized.
* Domain specific languages in software engineering are well suited for solving some particular problem and are built using a general purpose programming language. Being as formal as the general purpose programming language they are simpler and less applicable in general.
* Many art forms such as painting allow for different interpretations in a human language (i.e. different translations). Such art forms present an example of more applicable but less simple and less formal languages.

One implication of this hypothesis is that at a given intelligence level trying to use simpler and more formal languages will lead to these languages being narrower. This can be observed in many fields of science, where more sophisticated and formal theories are built to describe the ever growing number of specialized fields. The main reason for this apparent fragmentation and specialization of science is the limitation of human intelligence and its inability to build sufficiently applicable and at the same time formal and simple enough languages.

##Human intelligence and its limitations

One particular case of intelligence is human intelligence. As we discussed before it is also defined by the set of languages that can be constructed and understood by in this case an average human.

From observing a number of still not fully solved and well understood problems in the observable world in general and mathematics in particular we can guess that the human intelligence is actually quite limited by its nature. For example, it is apparently not able to build a universally applicable formal and simple language. In fact, many of the very core concepts and notions that humans are routinely using to reason with at a closer look turn out to be not all that universal and in fact specific just to some of the languages constructed and understood by humans. These core concepts are seemingly not inherent in the perceived world or information itself but are just artefacts of the human mind.

Thinking in terms of __objects__, __actions__ and __changes__ is a common human way to imagine the world as if it indeed consists of objects that have some state and can change after some action is applied to them. Trees, animals, cars, houses and many other things are all perceived as objects: an object can be both a source of action on other objects or can experience an action itself. The effect of a particular action is then some *change* on the state of this object. But do we really always need objects, actions and change to encode information about the perceived world? The answer we get from the pure mathematics, geometry and functional programming languages is clearly - no. We have multiple examples that it is possible to do just fine with abstract symbolic notation that is not concerned with objects, actions or changes, and at the same time is formal and simple. Unfortunately it turns out that such a symbolic notation will not always be applicable widely enough and might be too overspecialized for solving some particular task, but this has nothing to do with the notation itself but rather with the limitations of the human intelligence.

The same reasoning is true about __time__, __non-determinism__ and __causality__ as it is possible to build many formal and simple languages that do not either of these concepts. An interesting example of how time and non-determinism are artificial and non-essential is provided, for example, by Game Theory: every normal form game can be rewritten as a non-deterministic extensive form game. We can find another example in statistical methods of mathematics: when it is not simple enough to compute some values we can make a few assumptions and then deal with a less formal 'non-deterministic' model that is much easier to analyze.

It seems that the concepts of __time__, __non-determinism__, __causality__, __objects__, __actions__ and __change__ are merely mental devices that humans tend to incorporate in most of the languages understood by them and are non-essential in the perceived world.

Having discovered this it is interesting to recall the famous Plato dialog, Euthyphro http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics-shorter/#13 which discusses causality and shows that we cannot easily determine which of the several concepts presented in the dialog is the primary one causing the other concepts (to be precise, the discussion is about how piety can be defined through other notions). Now we understand why we cannot make such a determination: the concept of causality is deeply flawed, non-universal and non-applicable in this and many other cases. So it is not always correct to ask to define one thing through the others. The same, by the way, can be observed in many axiomatic systems: there are just concepts that are not caused by or do not follow from other concepts, which is yet another indication that causality is not universal.

__*Hypothesis 2. (non-causal determinism)*__
> The concepts of time, non-determinism, causality, object, action and change are specific to a certain class of languages that can be constructed by humans and are non-essential to encoding information and perceiving the world. The information and the world themselves are non-causal and deterministic.

Interestingly enough many of the things commonly observable by humans seems to be cyclical in nature, these are either simple cycles or superposition of many cycles. According to the last hypothesis the cyclical nature of things is just a pecularity of human perception and an illustion, as in reality the things are not cyclical, although they are often perceived as such due to the limitations of the human intelligence. Discussing cycles we can also recall the modern view of the dual nature of particles in Physics: it can be convenient to model partiles as waves. We should not be surprized if the further progress of Physics eventually will show that imagining particles as waves or even imagining particles is just an oversimplification and a mere mental device and the reality is different, non-changing and deterministic. Although it also might be beyond any human intelligence to properly understand and model.

How can the human intelligence be expanded or improved? In order to be able to construct more languages humans may need to perceive more, have better measurement tools and information gathering devices and this is one way to improve the intelligence.

Another way that follows from the definition of intelligence is to be able to make the constructed languages simple enough by using appropriate tools. It can be that some particular language is already formal and applicable in the desired domain but at the same time it is not simple enough and requires a lot of computational resources or memory that an average human does not possesss. Historically for this purpose humans would use computers of different kinds, starting from abacus a few thousand years ago and ending in present with the digital machines built according to the von Neumann architecture.
