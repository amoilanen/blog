The topic of this article is not just JavaScript as a language, but also the surrounding ecosystem.

# <a name="past"></a> Past

* Quickly created in 10 days to add a bit of interactivity to HTML pages
* Some quirks, need to know "Good Parts"
* Bad reputation in the beginning due to confusing DOM APIs with the language itself
* Very succesful, ActionScript, Java applets did not replace it
* Agile and lightweight
* Many small libraries that are easy to create
* Rapid increases in productivity in the beginning with appearance of such libraries as jQuery in its time, now obsolete

# <a name="present"></a> Present

-:

* Increasingly used to build large apps, RIA
* Hard to use for larger apps, ES6 somewhat alleviates the pain
* No standard libraries
* No types, can be a minus for large projects
* Weak language core: designed quickly
* Million of libraries
* "Next year next framework comes along"
* Latest version not supported in browsers uniformely, requires compilation
* Small project may have several hundred Mb of dependencies
* Linting, compiling takes a lot of time
* Assembling libraries/tools/frameworks together is a lot of pain, although some patterns tend to emerge but they change quickly
* Steep learning curve, requires a lot to learn at the moment
* Diminishing relative productivity increases as the time goes as the language/ecosystem is quite old

+:

* Lightweight and agile for small apps
* Not a proprietary language
* Many Web related libraries written in JavaScript, easy to interact with and reuse, even old ones
* Supported by all browsers, de-factor standard
* Open environment that supports innovation and allows new libraries/frameworks appear

# <a name="alternatives"></a> Alternatives

Discuss why the following are not adopted as wide as they could have been

Dart
CoffeeScript
Elm
Scala.js
TypeScript
ClojureScript

# <a name="ideal"></a> Ideal

Combines pluses from JavaScript and addresses its minuses

Web Assembly https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/03/a-webassembly-milestone/
Language/framework can emerge that will replace JavaScript, not clear yet what it will be
Fragmentation? Different languages with different libraries?
