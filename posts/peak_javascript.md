The topic of this article is JavaScript and the surrounding ecosystem of libraries, frameworks and the Web. The title suggests that some kind of a peak in adoption of the language for the Web might have already been reached and the downside might have already started.

We will try to discuss some historical context, pros and cons of the present approaches and try to discern the patterns and what future holds for us as developers of the Web.

# <a name="past"></a> Past

* Quickly created in 10 days to add a bit of interactivity to HTML pages
* Some quirks, need to know "Good Parts"
* Bad reputation in the beginning due to confusing DOM APIs with the language itself
* Was easy to learn and has familiar syntax
* Not proprietary
* Open source by nature: viewing code in the browser, easy to reuse patterns
* Very succesful, ActionScript, Java applets did not replace it
* Agile and lightweight, good support of functional-like style of programming
* Many small libraries that are easy to create
* Rapid increases in productivity in the beginning with appearance of such libraries as jQuery in its time, now obsolete

# <a name="present"></a> Present

-:

* Increasingly used to build large apps, RIA
* Hard to use for larger apps, ES6 somewhat alleviates the pain
* No standard libraries
* No types, can be a minus for large projects
* Weak language core: designed quickly
* Million of libraries
* "Next year next framework comes along"
* Latest version not supported in browsers uniformely, requires compilation
* Small project may have several hundred Mb of dependencies
* Linting, compiling takes a lot of time
* Assembling libraries/tools/frameworks together is a lot of pain, although some patterns tend to emerge but they change quickly
* Steep learning curve, requires a lot to learn at the moment
* Diminishing relative productivity increases as the time goes as the language/ecosystem is quite old
* Tendency to greater complexity, things do not look so simple as before

+:

* Lightweight and agile for small apps
* Not a proprietary language
* Many Web related libraries written in JavaScript, easy to interact with and reuse, even old ones
* Supported by all browsers, de-factor standard
* Open environment that supports innovation and allows new libraries/frameworks appear
* Most of the libraries are open source, open nature of the Web also supports reuse/viewing source code unless deliberatly obfuscated
* Code once, run on any machine

# <a name="alternatives"></a> Alternatives

Discuss why the following are not adopted as wide as they could have been

Dart
CoffeeScript
Elm
Scala.js
TypeScript
ClojureScript

# <a name="ideal"></a> Ideal

Combines pluses from JavaScript and addresses its minuses

# <a name="future"></a> Future

Web Assembly https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/03/a-webassembly-milestone/
Language/framework can emerge that will replace JavaScript, not clear yet what it will be
Fragmentation? Different languages with different libraries?
